# docker-icloudpd
An Alpine Linux Docker container for ndbroadbent's iCloud Photos Downloader. I use it for syncing the photo streams of all the iDevices in my house back to my server because it's the only way of backing up multiple devices to a single location. It uses the system keyring to securely store credentials, has HEIC to JPG conversion capability, and supports Telegram, Prowl and WebHook notifications.

## MANDATORY ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

**apple_id**: This is the Apple ID that wil lbe used when downloading files.

## DEFAULT ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

~~**apple_password**: This is the password for the Apple ID account named above. This is needed to generate an authentication token. If this variable exists it will be used as the password when downloading files, but you will be prompted with a delayed warning that you should switch to a keyring based authentication. To use keyring based authentication, set the variable to **usekeyring** or omit it entirely. When keyring based authentication is enabled, the script will check for the presence of the keyring file. If it is not there, the script will pause with a warning for 5mins before exiting. Please connect to the container and run the /usr/local/bin/sync-icloud.sh command manually to start the process of saving your password to the keyring. This will invoke 2FA and Apple will text a confirmation code which needs to be entered. You may also be asked to generate a new 2FA cookie afterwards. If this variable is not set, it will default to 'usekeyring'.~~ This variable has now been decommissioned. Passwords can no longer be set via a variable and must be added to the keyring.

**user**: This is name of the user account that you wish to create within the container. This can be anything you choose, but ideally you would set this to match the name of the user on the host system for which you want to download files for. This user will be set as the owner of all downloaded files. If this variable is not set, it will default to 'user'.

**user_id**: This is the User ID number of the above user account. This can be any number that isn't already in use. Ideally, you should set this to be the same ID number as the user's ID on the host system. This will avoid permissions issues if syncing to your host's home directory. If this variable is not set, it will default to '1000'.

**group**: This is name of the group account that you wish to create within the container. This can be anything you choose, but ideally you would set this to match the name of the user's primary group on the host system. This This group will be set as the group for all downloaded files. If this variable is not set, it will default to 'group'.

**group_id**: This is the Group ID number of the above group. This can be any number that isn't already in use. Ideally, you should set this to be the same Group ID number as the user's primary group on the host system. If this variable is not set, it will default to '1000'.

**force_gid**: If this variable is set it will allow the group to be created with a pre-existing group id. This may be handy if your group id clashes with a system group insude the docker container, however, if may have undesired permissions issues. Please use with caution.

**TZ**: This is the local timezone and is required to calculate timestamps. If this variable is not set, it will default to Coordinated Universal Time 'UTC'.

**download_path**: This is the directory to which files will be downloaded from iCloud. If this variable is not set, it will default to "/home/${user}/iCloud".

**synchronisation_interval**: This is the number of seconds between synchronisations. It can be set to the following periods: 43200 (12hrs), 86400 (24hrs), 129600 (36hrs), 172800 (48hrs) and 604800 (7 days). If this variable is not set to one of these values, it will default to 86400 seconds. Be careful if setting a short synchronisation period. Apple have a tendency to throttle connections that are hitting their server too often. I find that every 24hrs is fine. My phone will upload files to the cloud immediately, so if I lose my phone the photos I've taken that day will still be safe in the cloud, and the container will download those phots when it runs in the evening.

**synchronisation_delay**: This is the number of minutes to delay the first synchronisation. This is so that you can stagger the synchronisations of multiple containers. If this value is not set. It will default to 0.

**notification_days**: When your cookie is nearing expiration, this is the number of days in advance it should notify you. This will default to 7 days if not specified so you will receive a single notification in the 7 days running up to cookie expiration.

**authentication_type**: This is the type of authentication that is enabled on your iCloud account. Valid values are '2FA' if you have two factor authentication enabled or 'Web' if you do not. If 'Web' is specified, then cookie generation is not required. If this variable is not set, it will default to '2FA'.

**directory_permissions**: This specifies the permissions to set on the directories in your download destination. If this variable is not set, it will default to 750.

**file_permissions**: This specifies the permissions to set on the files in your download destination. If this variable is not set, it will default to 640.

**folder_structure**: This specifies the folder structure to use in your download destination directory. If this variable is not set, it will set {:%Y/%m/%d} as the default. Use **none** to download to a flat file structure.

**download_notifications**: This variable specifies whether notifications with a short summary should be sent for file downloads. If this variable is not set, it will default to **True**.

**delete_notifications**: This variable specifies whether notifications with a short summary should be sent for file deletions. If this variable is not set, it will default to **True**.

**set_exif_datetime**: Write the DateTimeOriginal exif tag from file creation date. If this variable is not set, it will default to **False**.

**auto_delete**: Scans the "Recently Deleted" folder and deletes any files found in there. (If you restore the photo in iCloud, it will be downloaded again). If this variable is not set, it will default to **False**.

**photo_size**: Image size to download. Can be set to **original**, **medium** or **thumb**. If this variable is not set, it will default to **original**.

**skip_live_photos**: If this is set, it will skip downloading live photos. If this variable is not set, it will default to **False**.

**live_photo_size**: Live photo file size to download. Can be set to **original**, **medium** or **thumb**. If skip_live_photos is set, this setting is redundant. If this variable is not set, it will default to **original**.

**skip_videos**: If this is set, it will skip downloading videos. If this variable is not set, it will default to **False**.

**recent_only**: Set this variable to an integer number to only download this many recently added photos. If this variable is not set, it will default to downloading all photos.

**until_found**: Set this variable to an integer number to only download the most recently added photos, until *n* number of previously downloaded consecutive photos are found. If this variable is not set, it will default to downloading all photos.

## OPTIONAL ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

~~**interactive_only**: Some hosts only run containers interactively (looking at you Synology) and this means the script gets stuck attempting to create a 2FA cookie every time. Setting interactive_only will force the script to bypass the cookie generation function and sync files instead.~~ The container now defaults to downloading the files, rather than creating the cookie, so this variable is now obsolete.

**command_line_options**: This is for additional command line options you want to pass to the icloudpd application. The list of options for icloudpd can be found [HERE](https://github.com/ndbroadbent/icloud_photos_downloader#usage).

**convert_heic_to_jpeg**: This tells the container that it should convert any HEIC files it downloads to JPEG.

**jpeg_quality**: If HEIC to JPEG conversion is enabled, this variable will let you set the quality of the converted file by specifying a number from 0 (lowest quality) to 100 (highest quality) If convert_heic_to_jpeg is set, and this variable isn't, it will default to 90.

## NOTIFICATION CONFIGURATION VARIABLES

**notification_type**: This specifies the method that is used to send notifications. Currently, there are five options available **Prowl**, **Pushover**, **Telegram**, **Webhook** and **Dingtalk**. When the two factor authentication cookie is within 7 days (default) of expiry, a notification will be sent upon synchronisation. No more than a single notification will be sent within a 24 hour period unless the container is restarted. This does not include the notification that is sent each time the container is started.

**notification_title**: This allows you to change the title which is sent on the notifications. If this variable is not set, it will default to **boredazfcuk/iCloudPD**.

**prowl_api_key**: If the notification_type is set to 'Prowl' this is mandatory. This is the API key for your account as generated by the Prowl website.

**pushover_user**: If the notification_type is set to 'Pushover' this is mandatory. This is the user name that was chose when creating the Pushover account.

**pushover_token**: If the notification_type is set to 'Pushover' this is mandatory. This is the access token your account as generated by the Pushover website.

**telegram_token**: If the notification_type is set to 'Telegram' this is mandatory. This is the token that was assigned to your account by The Botfather.

**telegram_chat_id**: If the notification_type is set to 'Telegram' then this is the chat_id for your Telegram bot.

**webhook_server**: If the notification_type is set to 'Webhook' then this is the name of the server to connect to when sending webhook notifications.

**webhook_port**: If the notification_type is set to 'Webhook' then this is the port number to use when connecting to the webhook server. If this is not set, it will default to 8123.

**webhook_path**: If the notification_type is set to 'Webhook' then this is the path to use when connectiong to the webhook server. The path must start and end with a forward slash character. If this is not set, it will default to **/api/webhook/**.

**webhook_id**: If the notification_type is set to 'Webhook' then this is the Webhook ID to use.

**webhook_https**: If this is set to 'True then the Webhoot notification URL will use HTTPS, otherwise it will default to HTTP.

**dingtalk_token**: If the notification_type is set to 'Dingtalk' this is mandatory. This is the access token generated by the Dingtalk application(PC/Mac) , and the 'Security Settings' should select 'Custom Keywords' and enter the content of **notification_title**, it will default to **boredazfcuk/iCloudPD**.

## VOLUME CONFIGURATION

It also requires a named volume mapped to /config. This is where is stores the authentication cookie. Without it, it will lose the cookie information each time the container is recreated
It will download the photos to the "/home/${user}/iCloud" photos directory. You need to create a bind mount into the container at this point.

## FAILSAFE FEATURE

I have added a failsafe feature to this container so that it doesn't make any changes to the filesystem unless it can verify the volume it is writing to is mounted correctly. The container will look for a file called "/home/${user}/iCloud/.mounted" (please note the capitalisation of iCloud) in the download destination directory inside the container. If this file is not present, it will not download anything from iCloud. This way, if underlying disk/volume/whatever gets unmounted, sync will not occur and this prevents the script from filling up the root volume of the host. This file **MUST** be created manually and sync will not start without it.

## CREATING A CONTAINER

Creating a container can be as simple as running:
```
docker create \
   --network <Name of Docker network to connect to> \
   --env apple_id="<Apple ID e-mail address>" \
   --volume <Bind mount to the destination folder on the host> \
   boredazfcuk/icloudpd
```

Once the container has been created, you should connect to it and run the `sync-icloud.sh` script manually. This will then take you through the process of adding your password to the container's keyring. It will also take you through generating a cookie that will allow the container to download the photos...

But you probably want to customise your container a little more than that though, espcially if you have multiple instances of the container running and connecting to different iCloud acocunts.

I'd recommend creating your container with a little more info than that. Something along the lines of:

```
docker create \
   --name <Contrainer Name> \
   --hostname <Hostname of container> \
   --network <Name of Docker network to connect to> \
   --restart=always \
   --env user=<User Name> \
   --env user_id=<User ID> \
   --env group=<Group Name> \
   --env group_id=<Group ID> \
   --env apple_id="<Apple ID e-mail address>" \
   --env authentication_type=<2FA or Web> \
   --env command_line_options="<Any additional commands you wish to pass to icloudpd>" \
   --env synchronisation_interval=<Include this if you wish to override the default interval of 24hrs> \
   --env notification_type=<Choice of Prowl, Pushover, Webhook and Telegram> \
   --env notification_days=<Number of days for which to send cookie expiry notifications> \
   --env TZ=<The local time zone> \
   --volume <Named volume which is mapped to /config> \
   --volume <Bind mount to the destination folder on the host> \
   boredazfcuk/icloudpd
   ```
   
   So an example of a true command would look something like this:
   
   ```
   docker create \
   --name iCloudPD-boredazfcuk \
   --hostname icloudpd_boredazfcuk \
   --network containers \
   --restart=always \
   --env user=boredazfcuk \
   --env user_id=1000 \
   --env group=admins \
   --env group_id=1010 \
   --env apple_id=thisisnotmy@email.com \
   --env apple_password="neitheristhismypassword" \
   --env authentication_type=2FA \
   --env notification_type=Telegram \
   --env telegram_token=123654 \
   --env telegram_chat_id=456321 \
   --env folder_structure={:%Y}
   --env auto_delete=True \
   --env notification_days=14 \
   --env synchronisation_interval=21600 \
   --env TZ=Europe/London \
   --volume icloudpd_boredazfcuk_config:/config \
   --volume /home/boredazfcuk/iCloud:/home/boredazfcuk/iCloud \
   boredazfcuk/icloudpd
   ```

## CONFIGURING A PASSWORD

If you launch a container without initialising it first, you will receive an error message similar to this:
```
ERROR    Keyring file /config/python_keyring/keyring_pass.cfg does not exist.
INFO      - Please add the your password to the system keyring using the --Initialise script command line option.
INFO      - Syntax: docker exec -it <container name> sync-icloud.sh --Initialise
INFO      - Example: docker exec -it icloudpd sync-icloud.sh --Initialise
INFO     Restarting in 5 minutes...
```

As per the error, the container needs to be initialised by using the --Initialise command line option. With the first container still running, connect to it and launch the initialisation process by running the following at the terminal prompt:
```
docker exec -it <container name> sync-icloud.sh --Initialise
```
for example:
```
docker exec -it icloudpd sync-icloud.sh --Initialise
```

You will then be asked to log in to icloud.com, with your current Apple ID and password, and will be prompted to enter a two factor authentication code which will be sent via SMS. Once that is confirmed, the password will be added to the keyring.

If you do not have an authentication cookie, and you have two factor authentication enabled on your account, you will be taken to the cookie generation process immediately after.
   
## TWO FACTOR AUTHENTICATION

If your Apple ID account has two factor authentication enabled, you will see that the container waits for a two factor authentication cookie to be created:
```
ERROR    Cookie does not exist."
INFO      - Please create your cookie using the --Initialise script command line option."
INFO      - Syntax: docker exec -it <container name> sync-icloud.sh --Initialise"
INFO      - Example: docker exec -it icloudpd sync-icloud.sh --Initialise"
INFO     Restarting in 5 minutes..."
```

Without this cookie, synchronisation cannot be started.

As per the error, the container needs to be initialised by using the --Initialise command line option. With the first container still running, connect to it and launch the initialisation process by running the following at the terminal prompt:
```
docker exec -it <container name> sync-icloud.sh --Initialise
```
for example:
```
docker exec -it icloudpd sync-icloud.sh --Initialise
```

After that, the script will log into the icloud.com website and save the 2FA cookie. Your iDevice will ask you if you want to allow or deny the login. When you allow the login, you will be give a 6-digit approval code. Enter the approval code when prompted.

The process should look similar to this:

```

This will then place a two factor authentication cookie into the /config folder of the container. This cookie will expire after three months. After it has expired, you will need to re-initialise the container again.
   
After this, the container should start downloading your photos.
   
Dockerfile has a health check which will change the status of the container to 'unhealthy' if the cookie is due to expire within a set number of days (notification_days) and also if the download fails. 

## COMMAND LINE OPTIONS

There are currently a number of command line options available to use with the sync-icloud.sh script. These are:

**--ConvertAllHEICs**
The --ConvertAllHEICs command line option will check for HEIC files that do not have an accompanying JPEG file. If it finds a HEIC that does not have an accompaying JPEG file, it will create it. This can be used to add JPEGs for previously downloaded libraries. The easiest way to run this is to connect to the running container and executing the script.
To run the script inside the currently running container, issue this command:
```
docker exec -it icloudpd sync-icloud.sh --ConvertAllHEICs
```

**--CorrectJPEGTimestamps**
The --CorrectJPEGTimestamps command line option will correct the timestamps of JPEG files that do not match their accompanying HEIC files. Due to an omission, previous versions of my script never set the time stamp. This command line option will correct this issue.

To run the script inside the currently running container, issue this command:
```
docker exec -it icloudpd sync-icloud.sh --CorrectJPEGTimestamps
```

**--Initialise**
The --Initialise command line option will allow you to add your password to the system keyring. It will also force the creation of a new two-factor authentication cookie.
To run the script inside the currently running container, issue this command:
```
docker exec -it icloudpd sync-icloud.sh --Initialise
```

## HEALTH CHECK

I have built in a health check for this container. If the script detects a download error the container will be marked as unhealthy. You can then configure this container: https://hub.docker.com/r/willfarrell/autoheal/ to monitor iCloudPD and restart the unhealthy container. Please note, if your 2FA cookie expires, the container will be marked as unhealthy, and will be restarted by the authoheal container every five minutes or so... This can lead to a lot of notifications if it happens while you're asleep!
